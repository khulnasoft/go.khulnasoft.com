# `pkg/` â€“ Utility Packages for Khulnasoft ðŸš€  

The `pkg/` directory is a collection of independent utility packages used within the **Khulnasoft** project. Keeping them separate from the core codebase ensures modularity, maintainability, and reusability.  

## ðŸŒŸ Why `pkg/`?  

âœ… **Decoupled & Lightweight** â€“ Keeps the core codebase clean and efficient.  
âœ… **Potential for Expansion** â€“ If a utility stabilizes and grows in scope, it may be moved to its own repository under the **Khulnasoft** organization.  
âœ… **Inspired by the Best** â€“ This structure follows the approach used in the [Camlistore](https://github.com/camlistore) project, pioneered by **Brad Fitzpatrick**, a core Go maintainer. Thanks, Brad! ðŸ™Œ
